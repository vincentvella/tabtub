## TabTub

I've noticed that I consistently have the same 3/4 tabs open all day so I made a small electron app designed to allow me to focus the app and use hotkeys to snap to different open tabs. Chrome, Arc, Safari - they support bookmarks but overall I tend to find it really difficult to keep track of what's open and when.
